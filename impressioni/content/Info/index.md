I am Leonardo Salicari (aka loscati here on the internet) and I am an amateur photographer.

This website is an effort to collect some of the photographic projects I have done in the past.
This website does not containe all my photos and is not meant to be a proper portfolio, but an experiment to share some of the photo that I took and are connected through a theme or visual grammar.

If you want know more about me, see my [main website](https://loscati.github.io/).
If you notice some errors, open a [issue on github](https://github.com/loscati/impressioni/issues).

This website is based on the Bridget theme, a _minimal_ Hugo theme designed for photographers/visual artists, powered by <u>[Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com)</u>.

To know more about the website (which is open source with MIT license), see:
